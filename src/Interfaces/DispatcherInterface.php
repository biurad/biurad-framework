 * BiuradPHP Framework is a new scheme of php architecture which is simple,  |
 * yet has powerful features. The framework has been built carefully 	     |
 * following the rules of the new PHP 7.2 and 7.3 above, with no support     |
 * for the old versions of PHP. As this framework was inspired by            |
 * several conference talks about the future of PHP and its development,     |
 * this framework has the easiest and best approach to the PHP world,        |
 * of course, using a few intentionally procedural programming module.       |
 * This makes BiuradPHP framework extremely readable and usable for all.     |
 * BiuradPHP is a 35% clone of symfony framework and 30% clone of Nette	     |
 * framework. The performance of BiuradPHP is 300ms on development mode and  |
 * on production mode it's even better with great defense security.          |
